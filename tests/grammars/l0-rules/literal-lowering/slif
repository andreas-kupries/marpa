# This test grammar demonstrates how the semantics transform strings
# and charclasses into simpler constructs, i.e. characters, ranges,
# and named classes, and glue them back together with priority rules.

# Note: The grammar does not allow empty strings, nor empty
#       charclasses.

A ::= B C
      D E
      F G H I
      J K L M

# Strings
B ::= 'a'
C ::= 'abc'

D ::= 'a':i
E ::= 'abc':i

# Char classes (TODO: negated)
F ::= [a]
G ::= [a-z]
H ::= [[:alnum:]]
I ::= [a0-9[:braille:]]

J ::= [a]:i
K ::= [a-z]:i
L ::= [[:alnum:]]:i
M ::= [a0-9[:braille:]]:i
