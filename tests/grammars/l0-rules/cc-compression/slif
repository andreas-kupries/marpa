# Demonstrate that the simple elements of char classes,
# i.e. characters and ranges are properly compressed, i.e merged as
# much as possible, into the smallest set of largest ranges to cover
# them.

# Note, named classes are excluded. While we loose some of the
# optimality we gain the use of their pre-made definitions and do not
# (have to) spend time on compiling a possibly large set of
# characters.

# Note further, this is only the semantics. A specific generator
# backend may and can decide otherwise.
