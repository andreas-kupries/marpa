# This charclass is mangled in the output of
# generator `tparse`. One of the generated
# char ranges is rejected by Tcl's regexp
# command, as invalid syntax.
##
# This test case serves as the demonstration
# of both issue and fix.

# Issue located in `marpa::gen::runtime::tcl`:
# -> ConvertLiterals -> CC -> RA -> CX -> Char -> `char quote tcl`

# The issue with `char quote tcl` is its conversion of any control
# char to octal representation. This is missing that we have control
# chars outside the ASCII range, in the higher BMP, and that is where
# bogosity happened. Bogus octal reps, longer than 3 octal
# digits. Forcing all characters outside of the ASCII range to \u
# and \U representation fixes the problem.
