# This grammar and its example demonstrate where a new lexer starts
# with the parser exhausted, and not having any acceptable lexeme from
# the beginning. This has to properly close the initial earleme with
# no alternatives, and further properly communicate to the gate that
# no input is acceptable.

A ::= C
C ::= B
B ~ 'b'
