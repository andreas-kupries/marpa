match location	Location of the next character to process.
      		Location where to resume processing.

match stop	Location where to stop the engine, before processing
		the character at the location.

match from F	Move location to F. Resume processing with F

      	    	Range 0 ... size

		size => Resume after the last character of the input
		     => Stop processing (not event)

match to S	Stop processing just before S.

      	 	Range 0 ... size

		0     => Stop before the first character of the input

		size  => Stop before the non-existing character after the input
		      <=> Stop just after the last character.

match limit L	Process the next L characters, then stop.

      	    	Assuming `from F` this is equivalent to `to (F+L-1)`.

Precedence

	Handling a `to size` (triggering a stop event) has
	precedence over EOF processing.

	If the handler for the stop event does not move the location
	then EOF processing will happen after the stop event was
	handled. (Because after handling a `to S` the stop marker is
	cleared and cannot trigger a second time if not regenerated by
	the event handler).
